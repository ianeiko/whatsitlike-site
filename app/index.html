            <p>Today, we have hundreds, if not thousands of sources of inspiration about where to go. It has been the primary question up till now. However, there is a whole layer of timing that often gets ignored. And it's this layer that has the greatest potential to amplify our travel experiences.</p> 
            <p>You've seen Atacama desert, but have you seen it blooming? Trust us, the latter is a much richer experience and it depends on the timing of your visit.</p> 
            <p>With What's it like we aim to bring the long deserved attention to the question of when to go.</p>
